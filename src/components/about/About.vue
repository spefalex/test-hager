            Are we human because of unique traits and attributes not shared with
            either animal or machine? The definition of “human” is circular: we
            are human by virtue of the properties that make us human (i.e.,
            distinct from animal and machine). It is a definition by negation:
            that which separates us from animal and machine is our “human-ness”.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are human because we are not animal, nor machine. But such
            thinking has been rendered progressively less tenable by the advent
            of evolutionary and neo-evolutionary theories which postulate a
            continuum in nature between animals and Man.
          </p>
          <p>
            d as “human”. But is it really? And if it is not – why isn’t it?
          </p>
          <p>
            Literature is full of stories of monsters – Frankenstein, the Golem
            – and androids or anthropoids. Their behaviour is more “humane” than
            the humans around them. This, perhaps, is what really sets humans
            apart: their behavioural unpredictability. It is yielded by the
            interaction between Mankind’s underlying immutable
            genetically-determined nature – and Man’s kaleidoscopically changing
            environments.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Constructivists even claim that Human Nature is a mere cultural
            artefact. Sociobiologists, on the other hand, are determinists. They
            believe that human nature – being the inevitable and inexorable
            outcome of our bestial ancestry – cannot be the subject of moral
            judgment.
          </p>
          <p>
            An improved Turing Test would look for baffling and erratic patterns
            of misbehaviour to identify humans. Pico della Mirandola wrote in
            “Oration on the Dignity of Man” that Man was born without a form and
            can mould and transform – actually, create – himself at will.
            Existence precedes essence, said the Existentialists centuries
            later.
          </p>
          <p>
            The one defining human characteristic may be our awareness of our
            mortality. The automatically triggered, “fight or flight”, battle
            for survival is common to all living things (and to appropriately
            programmed machines). Not so the catalytic effects of imminent
            death. These are uniquely human. The appreciation of the fleeting
            translates into aesthetics, the uniqueness of our ephemeral life
            breeds morality, and the scarcity of time gives rise to ambition and
            creativity.
          </p>
          <p>
            In an infinite life, everything materializes at one time or another,
            so the concept of choice is spurious. The realization of our
            finiteness forces us to choose among alternatives. This act of
            selection is predicated upon the existence of “free will”. Animals
            and machines are thought to be devoid of choice, slaves to their
            genetic or human programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, all these answers to the question: “What does it mean to be
            human” – are lacking.
          </p>
          <p>
            The set of attributes we designate as human is subject to profound
            alteration. Drugs, neuroscience, introspection, and experience all
            cause irreversible changes in these traits and characteristics. The
            accumulation of these changes can lead, in principle, to the
            emergence of new properties, or to the abolition of old ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            Animals and machines are not supposed to possess free will or
            exercise it. What, then, about fusions of machines and humans
            (bionics)? At which point does a human turn into a machine? And why
            should we assume that free will ceases to exist at that – rather
            arbitrary – point?
          </p>
          <p>
            Introspection – the ability to construct self-referential and
            recursive models of the world – is supposed to be a uniquely human
            quality. What about introspective machines? Surely, say the critics,
            such machines are PROGRAMMED to introspect, as opposed to humans. To
            qualify as introspection, it must be WILLED, they continue. Yet, if
            introspection is willed – WHO wills it? Self-willed introspection
            leads to infinite regression and formal logical paradoxes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, the notion – if not the formal concept – of “human” rests
            on many hidden assumptions and conventions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Political correctness notwithstanding – why presume that men and
            women (or different races) are identically human? Aristotle thought
            they were not. A lot separates males from females – genetically
            (both genotype and phenotype) and environmentally (culturally). What
            is common to these two sub-species that makes them both “human”?
          </p>
          <p>
            Can we conceive of a human without body (i.e., a Platonian Form, or
            soul)? Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas think not. A soul has no
            existence separate from the body. A machine-supported energy field
            with mental states similar to ours today – would it be considered
            human? What about someone in a state of coma – is he or she (or it)
            fully human?
          </p>
          <p>
            Is a new born baby human – or, at least, fully human – and, if so,
            in which sense? What about a future human race – whose features
            would be unrecognizable to us? Machine-based intelligence – would it
            be thought of as human? If yes, when would it be considered human?
          </p>
          <p>
            In all these deliberations, we may be confusing “human” with
            “person”. The former is a private case of the latter. Locke’s person
            is a moral agent, a being responsible for its actions. It is
            constituted by the continuity of its mental states accessible to
            introspection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Locke’s is a functional definition. It readily accommodates
            non-human persons (machines, energy matrices) if the functional
            conditions are satisfied. Thus, an android which meets the
            prescribed requirements is more human than a brain dead person.
          </p>
          <p>
            Descartes’ objection that one cannot specify conditions of
            singularity and identity over time for disembodied souls is right
            only if we assume that such “souls” possess no energy. A bodiless
            intelligent energy matrix which maintains its form and identity over
            time is conceivable. Certain AI and genetic software programs
            already do it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strawson is Cartesian and Kantian in his definition of a “person” as
            a “primitive”. Both the corporeal predicates and those pertaining to
            mental states apply equally, simultaneously, and inseparably to all
            the individuals of that type of entity. Human beings are one such
            entity. Some, like Wiggins, limit the list of possible persons to
            animals – but this is far from rigorously necessary and is unduly
            restrictive.
          </p>
          <p>
            The truth is probably in a synthesis:
          </p>
          <p>
            A person is any type of fundamental and irreducible entity whose
            typical physical individuals (i.e., members) are capable of
            continuously experiencing a range of states of consciousness and
            permanently having a list of psychological attributes.
          </p>
          <p>
            This definition allows for non-animal persons and recognizes the
            personhood of a brain damaged human (“capable of experiencing”). It
            also incorporates Locke’s view of humans as possessing an
            ontological status similar to “clubs” or “nations” – their personal
            identity consists of a variety of interconnected psychological
            continuities.
